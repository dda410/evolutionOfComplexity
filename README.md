# EVOLUTION OF COMPLEXITY

## Overview

Project spanning from the evolutionary computation core concepts to
the reimplementation and extension of a computational model of
biological bacteria growth.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- __Assignments__: contains the source code of the two different parts
  of this assignment. The first one implements a genetic algorithms
  to solve a toy problem. The second one implements an evolutionary
  computational model of biological bacteria growth. 
  
- __report__: contains the report describing the reimplementation and
  extension of the second part of the project.
